# CloudLaunch AWS Deployment

This repository contains the setup steps and configurations for **CloudLaunch**, covering:

- **Task 1:** Deploy a static website to Amazon S3 with IAM-based access control.
- **Task 2:** Design a secure AWS VPC environment with proper subnet separation and security group rules.

## üìå Task 1 ‚Äì S3 Static Website Hosting

### Objective
Host a static website on **Amazon S3** with a dedicated IAM user (`cloudlaunch-user`) having **read-only** access to the bucket.

### Steps Taken

1. **Created Three S3 Bucket**

   By clicking through S3 console;

BUCKET NAMES: cloudlaunch-site-bucket-85 ; cloudlaunch-private-bucket-10 ; and cloudlaunch-visible-only-bucket-25

**Enabled Static Website Hosting in the AWS console**

Uploaded index.html and error.html

Configured Bucket Policy:

json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::cloudlaunch-site-bucket-85/*"
    }
  ]
}


**Created IAM User**

Username: ofoncloudlaunch-user

Assigned custom read-only policy for this bucket only.

**IAM Policy JSON**

      ]
    }
  ]
}

**Tested Access**

Verified via: aws s3 ls s3://cloudlaunch-site-bucket-85 --profile ofoncloudlaunch-user
